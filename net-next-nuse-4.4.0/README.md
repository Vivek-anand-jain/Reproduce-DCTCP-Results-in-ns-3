## What is this
This is a library operating system (LibOS) version of Linux kernel,
which will benefit in the couple of situations like:


* operating system personalization
* full featured network stack for kernel-bypass technology (a.k.a. a high-speed packet I/O mechanism) like
Intel DPDK, netmap, etc
* testing network stack in a complex scenario.


For more detail, please refer the document.

## Applications
Right now, we have 2 sub-projects of this LibOS.

- Network Stack in Userspace (NUSE)
_NUSE_ allows us to use Linux network stack as a library which any applications can directory use by linking the library.
Each application has its own network stack so, it provides an instant virtualized environment apart from a host operating system.
- Direct Code Execution (DCE)
_DCE_ provides network simulator integration with Linux kernel so that any Linux implemented network protocols are for a protocol under investigate. Check http://www.nsnam.org/overview/projects/direct-code-execution/ for more detail about DCE.
